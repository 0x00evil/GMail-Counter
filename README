This is my first experiment of useful Safari 5 Extension. It's build using only CSS3, Javascript, HTML5 and the Apple's Safari Extension API.

Features:
 * Toolbar button with a badge showing the number of unread mails.
 * GMail Head Viewer, an extension bar showing the subject of the latest twenty mails in your Inbox
 * Click on a subject to read the mail or in the others parts of the bar to see the next message
 * Write a new mail from a button in the Head Viewer
 * You can select only a label or all (i.e. "Inbox", "Draft", "Work", "All") to be shown in the mail count and in the bar

Changes Log:
 * 0.6: added the GMail Head Viewer
 * 0.5.1b: First release on GitHub
 * 0.5.1: Minor update - bug fixes
 * 0.5: First public release

Known issues:
 * Once you logged-in there isn't a way to log-out or change account - if someone can help...
 * On Windows XP and 7 (and maybe Vista, too) sometimes it fails the installation - unknown causes, maybe a Safari bug or a certificate issue
