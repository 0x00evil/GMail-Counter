This is my first experiment of useful Safari 5 Extension. It's build using only CSS3, Javascript, HTML5 and the Apple's Safari Extension API.

Features:
 * Toolbar button with a badge showing the number of unread mails.
 * Head Viewer, an extension bar showing the subject of the latest twenty mails in your Inbox
 * Color of the Head Viewer calculated from the sender of the message
 * Click on a subject to read the mail or in the others parts of the bar to see the next message
 * Click the "New" button to compose a new message
 * Click the "Hide" button to hide the current message from the bar (YOU STILL HAVE TO READ THE MESSAGE IN GMAIL TO MARK IT AS READ DUE TO FEED LIMITATIONS)
 * Click the "X" button to close all bars
 * You can select only a label or all (i.e. "Inbox", "Draft", "Work", "All") to be shown in the mail count and in the bar
 * Login state in sync with main GMail page
 * Support for Google Apps

Changes Log:
 * 0.7.3: Integrate the 0.7.2 and add the "hide" button to the Head Viewer
 * 0.7.2: Added Piwik Track code and Auto-Hide feature to Head Viewer **NEVER RELEASED**
 * 0.7.1: No code changes. Updated to work with my new website
 * 0.7: New features and many fixes (check the wiki for more info)
